## 5. THỬ NGHIỆM
![Testing](/images/testing.png)
* Có một môi trường ở chế độ `test` nếu cần.

    _Tại sao:_
    > Đôi khi quá trình `end to end testing` trong chế độ `production`tương đối đầy đủ, đây là một số ngoại lệ: Một ví dụ bạn không muốn hiển thị chế độ 'production' và gây rối loạn hệ thống của người khác với dữ liệu thử nghiệm. 1 ví dụ khác là Api của bạn có thẻ có giới hạn về tỉ lệ trong chế độ `production` và chặn cuộc gọi thử nghiệm của bạn sau một số lượng yêu cầu nhất định.

* Đặt tệp kiểm tra của bạn bên cạnh các mô đun đã được thử nghiệm bằng cách sử dụng quy ước đặt tên `*.test.js` hoặc `*.spec.js`, như `moduleName.spec.js`.

    _Tại sao:_
    > Bạn không muốn tìm kiếm thông qua một cấu trúc thư mục để tìm một đơn vị test.[đọc thêm...](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)
    

* Đặt các tệp thử nghiệm bổ sung của bạn vào một thư mục thử nghiệm riêng biệt để tránh nhầm lẫn.

    _Tại sao:_
    > Một số tập tin thử nghiệm không đặc biệt liên quan đến bất kỳ tập tin thực hiện cụ thể nào.Bạn phải đặt nó trong một thư mục có nhiều khả năng được tìm thấy bởi các nhà phát triển khác: thư mục `__test__`. Tên này : `__test__`  cũng là chuẩn hiện tại và được chọn bởi hầu hết các khuôn khổ thử nghiệm JavaScript.

* Viết mã kiểm chứng, tránh các tác dụng phụ **side effects**, giải nén các tác dụng phụ, viết các hàm thuần túy

    _Tại sao:_
    > Nếu bạn muốn thử nghiệm một business logic như một đơn vị riêng biệt. Bạn có thể "giảm thiểu tác động ngẫu nhiên và các quy trình không xác định đối với độ tin cậy trong code của bạn". [read more...](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tdd-the-rite-way-53c9b46f45e3)
    
    > Một hàm thuần túy là một hàm luôn trả về cùng một đầu ra cho cùng một đầu vào. Ngược lại, một impure function là một chức năng có thể có các tác dụng phụ hoặc phụ thuộc vào các điều kiện từ bên ngoài để tạo ra một giá trị. Điều đó làm cho nó không dự đoán được. [read more...](https://hackernoon.com/structure-your-javascript-code-for-testability-9bc93d9c72dc)

* Sử dụng bộ kiểm tra tĩnh

    _Tại sao:_
    > Thỉnh thoảng chúng ta nên sử dụng bộ kiểm tra tĩnh. Nó mang lại sự tin cậy đối với sự chắc chắn trong code của bạn. [read more...](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb)


* Chạy test cục bộ trước khi lấy request từ `develop`.

    _Tại sao:_
    > You don't want to be the one who caused production-ready branch build to fail. Run your tests after your `rebase` and before pushing your feature-branch to a remote repository.

* Document your tests including instructions in the relevant section of your `README.md` file.

    _Why:_
    > It's a handy note you leave behind for other developers or DevOps experts or QA or anyone who gets lucky enough to work on your code.

<a name="structure-and-naming"></a>
## 6. Structure and Naming
![Structure and Naming](/images/folder-tree.png)
* Organize your files around product features / pages / components, not roles. Also, place your test files next to their implementation.


    **Bad**

    ```
    .
    ├── controllers
    |   ├── product.js
    |   └── user.js
    ├── models
    |   ├── product.js
    |   └── user.js
    ```

    **Good**

    ```
    .
    ├── product
    |   ├── index.js
    |   ├── product.js
    |   └── product.test.js
    ├── user
    |   ├── index.js
    |   ├── user.js
    |   └── user.test.js
    ```

    _Why:_
    > Instead of a long list of files, you will create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility including its test and so on. It gets much easier to navigate through and things can be found at a glance.

* Put your additional test files to a separate test folder to avoid confusion.

    _Why:_
    > It is a time saver for other developers or DevOps experts in your team.

* Use a `./config` folder and don't make different config files for different environments.

    _Why:_
    >When you break down a config file for different purposes (database, API and so on); putting them in a folder with a very recognizable name such as `config` makes sense. Just remember not to make different config files for different environments. It doesn't scale cleanly, as more deploys of the app are created, new environment names are necessary.
    Values to be used in config files should be provided by environment variables. [read more...](https://medium.com/@fedorHK/no-config-b3f1171eecd5)
    

* Put your scripts in a `./scripts` folder. This includes `bash` and `node` scripts.

    _Why:_
    >It's very likely you may end up with more than one script, production build, development build, database feeders, database synchronization and so on.
    

* Place your build output in a `./build` folder. Add `build/` to `.gitignore`.

    _Why:_
    >Name it what you like, `dist` is also cool. But make sure that keep it consistent with your team. What gets in there is most likely generated  (bundled, compiled, transpiled) or moved there. What you can generate, your teammates should be able to generate too, so there is no point committing them into your remote repository. Unless you specifically want to. 

<a name="code-style"></a>
## 7. Code style

![Code style](/images/code-style.png)

<a name="code-style-check"></a>
### 7.1 Some code style guidelines

* Use stage-2 and higher JavaScript (modern) syntax for new projects. For old project stay consistent with existing syntax unless you intend to modernise the project.

    _Why:_
    > This is all up to you. We use transpilers to use advantages of new syntax. stage-2 is more likely to eventually become part of the spec with only minor revisions. 

* Include code style check in your build process.

    _Why:_
    > Breaking your build is one way of enforcing code style to your code. It prevents you from taking it less seriously. Do it for both client and server-side code. [read more...](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/)

* Use [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](http://eslint.org/) to enforce code style.

    _Why:_
    > We simply prefer `eslint`, you don't have to. It has more rules supported, the ability to configure the rules, and ability to add custom rules.

* We use [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JavaScript, [Read more](https://www.gitbook.com/book/duk/airbnb-javascript-guidelines/details). Use the javascript style guide required by the project or your team.

* We use [Flow type style check rules for ESLint](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype) when using [FlowType](https://flow.org/).

    _Why:_
    > Flow introduces few syntaxes that also need to follow certain code style and be checked.

* Use `.eslintignore` to exclude files or folders from code style checks.

    _Why:_
    > You don't have to pollute your code with `eslint-disable` comments whenever you need to exclude a couple of files from style checking.

* Remove any of your `eslint` disable comments before making a Pull Request.

    _Why:_
    > It's normal to disable style check while working on a code block to focus more on the logic. Just remember to remove those `eslint-disable` comments and follow the rules.

* Depending on the size of the task use  `//TODO:` comments or open a ticket.

    _Why:_
    > So then you can remind yourself and others about a small task (like refactoring a function or updating a comment). For larger tasks use `//TODO(#3456)` which is enforced by a lint rule and the number is an open ticket.


* Always comment and keep them relevant as code changes. Remove commented blocks of code.
    
    _Why:_
    > Your code should be as readable as possible, you should get rid of anything distracting. If you refactored a function, don't just comment out the old one, remove it.

* Avoid irrelevant or funny comments, logs or naming.

    _Why:_
    > While your build process may(should) get rid of them, sometimes your source code may get handed over to another company/client and they may not share the same banter.

* Make your names search-able with meaningful distinctions avoid shortened names. For functions use long, descriptive names. A function name should be a verb or a verb phrase, and it needs to communicate its intention.

    _Why:_
    > It makes it more natural to read the source code.

* Organize your functions in a file according to the step-down rule. Higher level functions should be on top and lower levels below.

    _Why:_
    > It makes it more natural to read the source code.

<a name="enforcing-code-style-standards"></a>
### 7.2 Enforcing code style standards

* Use a [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file which helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs on the project.

    _Why:_
    > The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

* Have your editor notify you about code style errors. Use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) with your existing ESLint configuration. [read more...](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#installation)

* Consider using Git hooks.

    _Why:_
    > Git hooks greatly increase a developer's productivity. Make changes, commit and push to staging or production environments without the fear of breaking builds. [read more...](http://githooks.com/)

* Use Prettier with a precommit hook.

    _Why:_
    > While `prettier` itself can be very powerful, it's not very productive to run it simply as an npm task alone each time to format code. This is where `lint-staged` (and `husky`) come into play. Read more on configuring `lint-staged` [here](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration) and on configuring `husky` [here](https://github.com/typicode/husky).


<a name="logging"></a>
## 8. Logging

![Logging](/images/logging.png)

* Avoid client-side console logs in production

    _Why:_
    > Even though your build process can (should) get rid of them, make sure that your code style checker warns you about leftover console logs.

* Produce readable production logging. Ideally use logging libraries to be used in production mode (such as [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) or
[node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)).

    _Why:_
    > It makes your troubleshooting less unpleasant with colorization, timestamps, log to a file in addition to the console or even logging to a file that rotates daily. [read more...](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial/)


<a name="api"></a>
## 9. API
<a name="api-design"></a>

![API](/images/api.png)

### 9.1 API design

_Why:_
> Because we try to enforce development of sanely constructed RESTful interfaces, which team members and clients can consume simply and consistently.  

_Why:_
> Lack of consistency and simplicity can massively increase integration and maintenance costs. Which is why `API design` is included in this document.


* We mostly follow resource-oriented design. It has three main factors: resources, collection, and URLs.
    * A resource has data, gets nested, and there are methods that operate against it.
    * A group of resources is called a collection.
    * URL identifies the online location of resource or collection.
    
    _Why:_
    > This is a very well-known design to developers (your main API consumers). Apart from readability and ease of use, it allows us to write generic libraries and connectors without even knowing what the API is about.

* use kebab-case for URLs.
* use camelCase for parameters in the query string or resource fields.
* use plural kebab-case for resource names in URLs.

* Always use a plural nouns for naming a url pointing to a collection: `/users`.

    _Why:_
    > Basically, it reads better and keeps URLs consistent. [read more...](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-plural-nouns-and-concrete-names)

* In the source code convert plurals to variables and properties with a List suffix.

    _Why_:
    > Plural is nice in the URL but in the source code, it’s just too subtle and error-prone.

* Always use a singular concept that starts with a collection and ends to an identifier:

    ```
    /students/245743
    /airports/kjfk
    ```
* Avoid URLs like this: 
    ```
    GET /blogs/:blogId/posts/:postId/summary
    ```

    _Why:_
    > This is not pointing to a resource but to a property instead. You can pass the property as a parameter to trim your response.

* Keep verbs out of your resource URLs.

    _Why:_
    > Because if you use a verb for each resource operation you soon will have a huge list of URLs and no consistent pattern which makes it difficult for developers to learn. Plus we use verbs for something else.

* Use verbs for non-resources. In this case, your API doesn't return any resources. Instead, you execute an operation and return the result. These **are not** CRUD (create, retrieve, update, and delete) operations:

    ```
    /translate?text=Hallo
    ```

    _Why:_
    > Because for CRUD we use HTTP methods on `resource` or `collection` URLs. The verbs we were talking about are actually `Controllers`. You usually don't develop many of these. [read more...](https://byrondover.github.io/post/restful-api-guidelines/#controller)

* The request body or response type is JSON then please follow `camelCase` for `JSON` property names to maintain the consistency.
    
    _Why:_
    > This is a JavaScript project guideline, where the programming language for generating and parsing JSON is assumed to be JavaScript.

* Even though a resource is a singular concept that is similar to an object instance or database record, you should not use your `table_name` for a resource name and `column_name` resource property.

    _Why:_
    > Because your intention is to expose Resources, not your database schema details.

* Again, only use nouns in your URL when naming your resources and don’t try to explain their functionality.

    _Why:_
    > Only use nouns in your resource URLs, avoid endpoints like `/addNewUser` or `/updateUser` .  Also avoid sending resource operations as a parameter.

* Explain the CRUD functionalities using HTTP methods:

    _How:_
    > `GET`: To retrieve a representation of a resource.
    
    > `POST`: To create new resources and sub-resources.
   
    > `PUT`: To update existing resources.
    
    > `PATCH`: To update existing resources. It only updates the fields that were supplied, leaving the others alone.
    
    > `DELETE`:	To delete existing resources.


* For nested resources, use the relation between them in the URL. For instance, using `id` to relate an employee to a company.

    _Why:_
    > This is a natural way to make resources explorable.

    _How:_

    > `GET      /schools/2/students	` , should get the list of all students from school 2.

    > `GET      /schools/2/students/31`	, should get the details of student 31, which belongs to school 2.

    > `DELETE   /schools/2/students/31`	, should delete student 31, which belongs to school 2.

    > `PUT      /schools/2/students/31`	, should update info of student 31, Use PUT on resource-URL only, not collection.

    > `POST     /schools` , should create a new school and return the details of the new school created. Use POST on collection-URLs.

* Use a simple ordinal number for a version with a `v` prefix (v1, v2). Move it all the way to the left in the URL so that it has the highest scope:
    ```
    http://api.domain.com/v1/schools/3/students	
    ```

    _Why:_
    > When your APIs are public for other third parties, upgrading the APIs with some breaking change would also lead to breaking the existing products or services using your APIs. Using versions in your URL can prevent that from happening. [read more...](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-tips-versioning)



* Response messages must be self-descriptive. A good error message response might look something like this:
    ```json
    {
        "code": 1234,
        "message" : "Something bad happened",
        "description" : "More details"
    }
    ```
    or for validation errors:
    ```json
    {
        "code" : 2314,
        "message" : "Validation Failed",
        "errors" : [
            {
                "code" : 1233,
                "field" : "email",
                "message" : "Invalid email"
            },
            {
                "code" : 1234,
                "field" : "password",
                "message" : "No password provided"
            }
          ]
    }
    ```

    _Why:_
    > developers depend on well-designed errors at the critical times when they are troubleshooting and resolving issues after the applications they've built using your APIs are in the hands of their users.


    _Note: Keep security exception messages as generic as possible. For instance, Instead of saying ‘incorrect password’, you can reply back saying ‘invalid username or password’ so that we don’t unknowingly inform user that username was indeed correct and only the password was incorrect._

* Use these status codes to send with your response to describe whether **everything worked**,
The **client app did something wrong** or The **API did something wrong**.
    
    _Which ones:_
    > `200 OK` response represents success for `GET`, `PUT` or `POST` requests.

    > `201 Created` for when a new instance is created. Creating a new instance, using `POST` method returns `201` status code.

    > `204 No Content` response represents success but there is no content to be sent in the response. Use it when `DELETE` operation succeeds.

    > `304 Not Modified` response is to minimize information transfer when the recipient already has cached representations.

    > `400 Bad Request` for when the request was not processed, as the server could not understand what the client is asking for.

    > `401 Unauthorized` for when the request lacks valid credentials and it should re-request with the required credentials.

    > `403 Forbidden` means the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

    > `404 Not Found` indicates that the requested resource was not found. 

    > `500 Internal Server Error` indicates that the request is valid, but the server could not fulfill it due to some unexpected condition.

    _Why:_
    > Most API providers use a small subset HTTP status codes. For example, the Google GData API uses only 10 status codes, Netflix uses 9, and Digg, only 8. Of course, these responses contain a body with additional information.There are over 70 HTTP status codes. However, most developers don't have all 70 memorized. So if you choose status codes that are not very common you will force application developers away from building their apps and over to wikipedia to figure out what you're trying to tell them. [read more...](https://apigee.com/about/blog/technology/restful-api-design-what-about-errors)


* Provide total numbers of resources in your response.
* Accept `limit` and `offset` parameters.

* The amount of data the resource exposes should also be taken into account. The API consumer doesn't always need the full representation of a resource. Use a fields query parameter that takes a comma separated list of fields to include:
    ```
    GET /student?fields=id,name,age,class
    ```
* Pagination, filtering, and sorting don’t need to be supported from start for all resources. Document those resources that offer filtering and sorting.

<a name="api-security"></a>
### 9.2 API security
These are some basic security best practices:

* Don't use basic authentication unless over a secure connection (HTTPS). Authentication tokens must not be transmitted in the URL: `GET /users/123?token=asdf....`

    _Why:_
    > Because Token, or user ID and password are passed over the network as clear text (it is base64 encoded, but base64 is a reversible encoding), the basic authentication scheme is not secure. [read more...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)

* Tokens must be transmitted using the Authorization header on every request: `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx, Extra yyyyy`.

* Authorization Code should be short-lived.

* Reject any non-TLS requests by not responding to any HTTP request to avoid any insecure data exchange. Respond to HTTP requests by `403 Forbidden`.

* Consider using Rate Limiting.

    _Why:_
    > To protect your APIs from bot threats that call your API thousands of times per hour. You should consider implementing rate limit early on.

* Setting HTTP headers appropriately can help to lock down and secure your web application. [read more...](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)

* Your API should convert the received data to their canonical form or reject them. Return 400 Bad Request with details about any errors from bad or missing data.

* All the data exchanged with the REST API must be validated by the API.

* Serialize your JSON.

    _Why:_
    > A key concern with JSON encoders is preventing arbitrary JavaScript remote code execution within the browser... or, if you're using node.js, on the server. It's vital that you use a proper JSON serializer to encode user-supplied data properly to prevent the execution of user-supplied input on the browser.

* Validate the content-type and mostly use `application/*json` (Content-Type header).
    
    _Why:_
    > For instance, accepting the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` mime type allows the attacker to create a form and trigger a simple POST request. The server should never assume the Content-Type. A lack of Content-Type header or an unexpected Content-Type header should result in the server rejecting the content with a `4XX` response.

* Check the API Security Checklist Project. [read more...](https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist)

<a name="api-documentation"></a>
### 9.3 API documentation
* Fill the `API Reference` section in [README.md template](./README.sample.md) for API.
* Describe API authentication methods with a code sample.
* Explaining The URL Structure (path only, no root URL) including The request type (Method).

For each endpoint explain:
* URL Params If URL Params exist, specify them in accordance with name mentioned in URL section:

    ```
    Required: id=[integer]
    Optional: photo_id=[alphanumeric]
    ```

* If the request type is POST, provide working examples. URL Params rules apply here too. Separate the section into Optional and Required.

* Success Response, What should be the status code and is there any return data? This is useful when people need to know what their callbacks should expect:

    ```
    Code: 200
    Content: { id : 12 }
    ```

* Error Response, Most endpoints have many ways to fail. From unauthorized access to wrongful parameters etc. All of those should be listed here. It might seem repetitive, but it helps prevent assumptions from being made. For example
    ```json
    {
        "code": 403,
        "message" : "Authentication failed",
        "description" : "Invalid username or password"
    }   
    ```


* Use API design tools, There are lots of open source tools for good documentation such as [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
